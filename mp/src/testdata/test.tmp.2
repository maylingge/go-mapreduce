e tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
        not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
        shalt surely die.

002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
        alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
        field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
        to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
        every living creature, that was the name thereof.

002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
        and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
        found an help meet for him.

002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
        slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
        instead thereof;

002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
        woman, and brought her unto the man.

002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
        flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
        Man.

002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
        shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
        ashamed.

003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
        which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
        hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
        of the trees of the garden:

003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
        garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
        ye touch it, lest ye die.

003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
        eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
        and evil.

003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
        that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
        make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
        gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
        were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
        themselves aprons.
