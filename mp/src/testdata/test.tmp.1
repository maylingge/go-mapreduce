erein there
        is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
        so.

001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
        very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
        of them.

002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
        and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
        had made.

002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
        that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
        and made.

002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
        they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
        and the heavens,

002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
        every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
        not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
        to till the ground.

002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
        face of the ground.

002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
        breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
        a living soul.

002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
        he put the man whom he had formed.

002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
        that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
        life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
        knowledge of good and evil.

002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
        thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
        the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
        onyx stone.

002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
        compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
        goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
        Euphrates.

002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
        Eden to dress it and to keep it.

002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
        the garden thou mayest freely eat:

002:017 But of th
